# STATUS

## 2026-03-13 - Round 1

### Scope
- Target area: `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter` embedded runtime behavior consistency.
- Objective: make embedded runtime respect `openclawSkillInstallMode` (`openclaw_mirror` vs `store_only`) and verify with tests.

### Completed
- Baseline audit completed before coding:
  - Read core docs/config: `README.md`, `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/package.json`, plugin adapter source and tests.
  - Confirmed no root `Prompt.md` / `STATUS.md` existed.
  - Confirmed no CI workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.
- Implemented behavior fix in `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`:
  - Added `isMirrorInstallEnabled(cfg)`.
  - `skillInstallMode=store_only` now skips mirror copy to OpenClaw skills dir.
  - `skillInstallMode=openclaw_mirror` keeps existing mirror behavior.
  - Added structured result fields for observability when mirror is skipped:
    - `mirror_skipped: true`
    - `mirror_reason: "install_mode_store_only"`
- Added regression test in `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.test.mjs`:
  - `store_only` mode writes skill into AutoSkill SkillBank but does not mirror into OpenClaw skills dir.

### Validation
- Executed:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
- Result:
  - `24 passed, 0 failed`.

### Failed Attempts
- None in this round.

### Self-Review Notes
- Regression risk: low, change is gated by explicit install mode check.
- Backward compatibility:
  - default/unknown mode still behaves as mirror-enabled (`openclaw_mirror` semantics).
- Side effects:
  - no changes to `before_prompt_build`, memory hooks, provider hooks, or OpenClaw core paths.

### Remaining Issues / Risks
- Embedded mode env alias (`AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_NO_SIDECAR=1`) behavior is implemented but lacks explicit regression test.
- `embedded_runtime.js` and `embedded_runtime.test.mjs` are currently untracked files in git state and need final add/commit handling with related changes.
- Repository contains many unrelated modified files outside this scope; must avoid touching/reverting them.

### Next Step
- Round 2 (minimal increment):
  - Add config regression tests for no-sidecar env alias and install mode interplay.
  - Re-run adapter tests.
  - Update this `STATUS.md` with results.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 2

### Scope
- Target area: `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter` config fallback correctness.
- Objective: lock down no-sidecar env alias behavior and prevent silent mode fallback mistakes.

### Completed
- Added config regression tests in `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`:
  - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_NO_SIDECAR=1` enables `runtimeMode=embedded` when runtime mode is otherwise unset.
  - Explicit `runtimeMode=sidecar` keeps sidecar mode even when no-sidecar alias is set.
- Fixed `normalizeConfig` in `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`:
  - Treat empty `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_RUNTIME_MODE` as unset.
  - Prevent empty-string env from overriding `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_NO_SIDECAR=1`.

### Validation
- Executed:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
- Result:
  - `26 passed, 0 failed`.

### Failed Attempts
- Initial test run failed (`25 passed, 1 failed`):
  - Failure: no-sidecar alias test expected `embedded` but got `sidecar`.
  - Root cause: `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_RUNTIME_MODE=""` still participated in nullish-coalescing chain.
  - Resolution: normalize env runtime mode with trim and ignore empty string.

### Self-Review Notes
- Change is localized to config normalization logic; runtime behavior unchanged for explicit `runtimeMode`.
- Existing sidecar defaults remain intact.
- Added tests cover both positive and precedence path.

### Remaining Issues / Risks
- Adapter-related files `embedded_runtime.js` and `embedded_runtime.test.mjs` are still untracked in git state; needs explicit add/commit in integration step.
- Repository still contains many unrelated modified files; final merge should scope to plugin-specific paths only.

### Next Step
- Round 3 (integration finish line):
  - Final consistency pass on plugin docs vs config schema.
  - Optional: add one README note for `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_NO_SIDECAR=1` alias.
  - Prepare scoped commit set for OpenClaw plugin paths only.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 3

### Scope
- Target area: plugin docs/config consistency.
- Objective: make no-sidecar alias behavior discoverable and consistent with implemented precedence.

### Completed
- Updated docs:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`
- Added explicit mention:
  - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_NO_SIDECAR=1` as convenience alias.
  - precedence rule: explicit `runtimeMode` overrides alias.

### Validation
- Executed:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
- Result:
  - `26 passed, 0 failed`.

### Failed Attempts
- None in this round.

### Self-Review Notes
- Docs now match actual `normalizeConfig` precedence logic.
- No code-path changes in runtime behavior this round (documentation-only change + regression run).

### Remaining Issues / Risks
- Functional work for sidecar/embedded dual path is in place and validated at adapter test level.
- Remaining integration work is operational, not code correctness:
  - stage and commit only plugin-scoped files in a dirty worktree.
  - optional end-to-end validation in a real OpenClaw runtime environment.

### Completion Assessment
- Adapter-level feature target is **verifiably complete**:
  - no-sidecar embedded option available
  - BM25 maintenance retrieval in embedded path
  - session-closed extraction gating with successful `main` requirement
  - install mode semantics aligned (`store_only` no mirror, `openclaw_mirror` mirror)
  - regression tests passing
  - STATUS tracking in place

## 2026-03-13 - Round 4 (self-optimization)

### Scope
- Target area: embedded runtime + retrieval interaction.
- Objective: remove hidden default misbehavior where embedded mode could trigger sidecar-only retrieval calls.

### Issue Found (with evidence)
- In `normalizeConfig`, `store_only` previously auto-enabled `skillRetrieval`.
- In `runtimeMode=embedded` (no sidecar), `before_prompt_build` retrieval still tried calling sidecar hook endpoint.
- Impact:
  - unnecessary outbound calls and warning noise each turn
  - misleading runtime behavior in no-sidecar deployments

### Fix Applied
- In `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`:
  - added `autoDisableRetrievalByEmbeddedRuntime` default gate
  - `embedded` mode now disables retrieval by default unless explicitly enabled by config/env
  - added explicit disable reason: `embedded_runtime_mode`
  - improved log branch: `retrieval disabled by embedded runtime mode`
  - made `runtimeMode` empty string in config treated as unset (so no-sidecar alias still works)
- In docs:
  - updated embedded mode notes in `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md` and `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md` to state retrieval default-off in embedded mode.

### Test Coverage Added
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`:
  - embedded mode default disables retrieval
  - embedded mode explicit retrieval opt-in still works
  - empty `runtimeMode` config still honors no-sidecar alias
  - `before_prompt_build` in embedded default mode does not call external retrieval and logs expected disable reason

### Validation
- Executed:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
- Result:
  - `30 passed, 0 failed`.

### Failed Attempts
- None in this round.

### Self-Review Notes
- Risk/benefit:
  - high benefit: prevents silent per-turn misbehavior in no-sidecar default path
  - low risk: explicit retrieval opt-in remains available and tested
- Backward compatibility:
  - sidecar runtime defaults unchanged
  - openclaw_mirror retrieval-disable behavior unchanged

### Remaining Suggestions (not executed yet)
- Structural option: if product later requires `embedded + store_only + retrieval`, add local retrieval implementation in adapter (instead of sidecar HTTP hook dependency).
- Operational: final commit should include only plugin-scoped files due dirty worktree.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 5 (agent-trajectory robustness + prompt/path review)

### Scope
- Target area: agent trajectory ingestion robustness and OpenClaw skill artifact compatibility.
- Objective: reduce silent data loss during extraction/maintenance for tool-heavy agent sessions and improve generated SKILL.md safety.

### Issues Found (with evidence)
- Adapter dropped assistant turns when content was empty but `tool_calls` existed:
  - previous `normalizeMessages` only consumed `message.content`.
  - impact: tool-heavy trajectories could lose assistant evidence before `agent_end` extraction.
- Adapter mapped unknown roles to `user`, including `environment`:
  - impact: environment observations could be mislabeled as user intent.
- Embedded SKILL.md frontmatter did not sanitize newlines:
  - fields like `name/description/tags/triggers` could contain multiline LLM output and break frontmatter stability/parsing.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - added assistant fallback serialization for `tool_calls/function_call/refusal/audio/annotations`.
  - mapped `environment` role to `tool` (instead of coercing to `user`).
  - added tool fallback content extraction from `result/output/observation`.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`
  - added `oneLineYamlValue(...)` sanitizer.
  - frontmatter fields now force single-line safe values.
  - tags/triggers are normalized to one-line entries before rendering.

### Tests Added
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`
  - `buildEndPayload preserves assistant tool-call messages and maps environment to tool`.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.test.mjs`
  - `embedded runtime writes single-line frontmatter-safe metadata for generated SKILL.md`.

### Validation
- Executed:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `32 passed, 0 failed`
- Prompt-profile sanity check:
  - `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_agentic_prompt_profile.py`
  - result: `Ran 4 tests, OK`
- Note:
  - `python3 -m pytest ...` unavailable in current environment (`No module named pytest`), so fallback used direct unittest script execution.

### Prompt/Profile Review Summary
- Sidecar path (`AutoSkill4OpenClaw/agentic_prompt_profile.py`) prompt set is relatively complete for agent trajectories:
  - extraction prompt includes evidence hierarchy, boundary/recency rules, de-identification, optional `scripts/references/assets`.
  - maintenance decision prompt has add/merge/discard policy with trajectory-specific guidance.
  - merge prompt enforces concise executable prompt + no examples metadata expansion.
- Embedded path (`AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`) prompt set is currently much lighter:
  - works as minimal no-sidecar baseline.
  - lacks many sidecar-level guardrails (boundary detection, explicit provenance constraints, richer anti-oneoff criteria).

### Remaining Risks / Suggestions
- Structural (recorded, not executed in this round):
  - If embedded mode must match sidecar quality, either:
    - port a compact subset of `agentic_prompt_profile` rules into embedded prompts, or
    - expose a shared prompt profile package used by both Python and JS paths.
- OpenClaw integration operational checks:
  - ensure runtime/plugin config allows prompt augmentation when using `store_only` (`before_prompt_build` path).
  - in `openclaw_mirror` mode this is intentionally less critical since retrieval/invocation is delegated to OpenClaw native skill loading.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 6 (usage counters + safe pruning path)

### Scope
- Target area: OpenClaw plugin usage observability and stale-skill governance.
- Objective: add low-risk retrieval/usage counters (aligned with AutoSkill core counter model) without affecting OpenClaw main flow.

### Why this round
- User requirement: track skill retrieval/usage counts and support eventual stale-skill cleanup.
- Constraint: OpenClaw native `openclaw_mirror` retrieval/use path must remain untouched; tracking errors must never impact runtime behavior.

### Completed
- Added plugin-local usage tracker module:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_usage_tracking.py`
  - best-effort counters via store `record_skill_usage_judgments` / `get_skill_usage_stats`
  - in-memory session retrieval cache with TTL/size limits
  - default-safe pruning OFF (`prune_enabled=false`)
- Integrated tracker into OpenClaw service runtime:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/service_runtime.py`
  - `before_agent_start` remembers retrieval snapshots by `user_id + session_id`
  - `agent_end` records counters using explicit retrieval payload (preferred) or cached snapshot fallback
  - extraction chain remains unchanged; usage-tracking failures are swallowed/logged
  - when usage-based prune deletes skills, mirror sync is triggered (if mirror mode enabled)
  - added API endpoint:
    - `POST /v1/autoskill/openclaw/usage/stats`
  - exposed in capabilities/openapi
- Added adapter-side pass-through for usage signals:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - caches retrieval snapshot from `before_prompt_build` response per session
  - forwards retrieval snapshot on `agent_end` payload
  - forwards explicit `used_skill_ids` when present in event/context payload
  - all logic is additive and does not modify messages/system prompt replacement behavior
- Added runtime/config/env wiring:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/run_proxy.py`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/install.py`
  - new env knobs:
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_TRACKING_ENABLED`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PRUNE_ENABLED`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PRUNE_MIN_RETRIEVED`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PRUNE_MAX_USED`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_MAX_HITS_PER_TURN`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_MAX_PENDING_SESSIONS`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PENDING_TTL_S`
- Documentation updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`
  - added “Skill Usage Counters / 技能使用计数” section with safe defaults and stats endpoint.

### Validation
- JS adapter tests:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `33 passed, 0 failed`
- Python plugin tests:
  - `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py`
  - `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_service_runtime.py`
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  - result: all passing (`33` plugin Python tests total)

### Tests added/updated
- Added:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py`
- Updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_service_runtime.py`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`

### Risk assessment
- Low runtime risk:
  - usage tracking is best-effort and isolated from extraction/main request success path.
  - defaults keep auto-prune disabled.
- Known limitation:
  - in `openclaw_mirror` mode, if OpenClaw does not emit explicit used-skill signals, `used` counts are sparse.
  - retrieval counters are strongest in `store_only` + `before_prompt_build` path where retrieval snapshots are observable.

### Next optimization candidates
- Add optional “mirror-mode estimation” strategy (disabled by default) to infer usage from session replay + retrieval replay, with conservative confidence gating.
- Add lightweight usage trend endpoint (top retrieved / never used / recently used) for ops dashboards.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 7 (prune safety hardening + re-validation)

### Scope
- Target area: usage-based auto-pruning safety.
- Objective: prevent accidental skill pruning when runtime does not provide explicit used-skill signals.

### Issue Found
- Even with conservative defaults, if users manually enable prune in environments that do not reliably emit `used_skill_ids`, stale-skill pruning can become over-aggressive.

### Fix Applied
- Added hard safety gate in usage tracker:
  - `prune_require_explicit_used_signal` (default `true`).
  - when enabled, prune thresholds are suppressed (`0`) unless current payload includes explicit `used_skill_ids`.
- Wiring updates:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_usage_tracking.py`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/run_proxy.py`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/install.py`
- Docs updated (EN/ZH) with explicit safety behavior and env var:
  - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PRUNE_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_USED_SIGNAL=1`

### Tests Added/Updated
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py`
  - added prune gate regression (no used signal => prune disabled; with signal => prune enabled).
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_run_proxy_defaults.py`
  - added default assertion for `openclaw_usage_prune_require_explicit_used_signal=1`.

### Validation
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py` (pass)
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_run_proxy_defaults.py` (pass)
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'` (pass, 34 tests)
- `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test` (pass, 33 tests)

### Residual Risks
- In strict `openclaw_mirror` black-box usage flow, `used` counters still depend on upstream signal availability.
- This round intentionally favors false-negatives (do not prune) over false-positives (wrong prune), to keep runtime safety first.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 8 (streaming header correctness + cache isolation hardening)

### Scope
- Target area:
  - main-turn proxy stream forwarding robustness
  - adapter retrieval cache session isolation
- Objective:
  - prevent malformed stream response headers
  - avoid cross-user retrieval snapshot contamination when `session_id` collides

### Issues Found
- `openclaw_main_turn_proxy._copy_headers_to_client` could emit `Content-Length: 0` for stream forwarding when upstream carried `Content-Length`.
  - Risk: some clients may prematurely treat stream body as empty.
- Adapter retrieval cache keyed only by `session_id`.
  - Risk: multi-user deployments with same `session_id` can mix retrieval snapshots, affecting usage accounting quality.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_main_turn_proxy.py`
  - stream/header fix: do not synthesize `Content-Length: 0` when `content_length` is unknown (`None`).
  - keep explicit `Content-Length` only for non-stream path where body size is known.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - retrieval cache key changed to `user_id + session_id` (case-normalized).
  - threaded user key through `onRetrieval / consumeRetrieval / clearRetrieval` flow.
  - backward compatibility preserved for paths that do not provide user id.

### Tests Added/Updated
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_main_turn_proxy.py`
  - added regression: stream response header copy must not contain forced `content-length`.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`
  - added retrieval cache isolation test (`same session_id`, different users).
  - added backward compatibility test for missing user id cache flow.

### Validation
- Python:
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  - result: `35 passed, 0 failed`
- Adapter:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `35 passed, 0 failed`

### Residual Risks / Next Candidates
- Main-turn proxy currently logs extensively in tests/runtime; consider adding opt-in structured log levels if noise becomes operationally expensive.
- End-to-end live OpenClaw runtime verification (real gateway + real model stream edge cases) is still recommended before production rollout.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 9 (hard dedupe + session timeout closure + verification scripts)

### Scope
- Target area:
  - cross-trigger extraction dedupe (`main-turn` vs `agent_end`)
  - optional session idle-timeout closure for `agent_end` fallback extraction
  - runnable acceptance scripts for sidecar/embedded paths
- Objective:
  - reduce duplicate extraction/maintenance updates under mixed trigger configs
  - close stale sessions safely when `session_done` is missing
  - provide repeatable validation entrypoints for operators

### Issues Addressed
- Duplicate extraction risk remained when users explicitly enabled both:
  - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_MAIN_TURN_EXTRACT=1`
  - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_AGENT_END_EXTRACT=1`
- Session close fallback previously depended only on:
  - `session_done=true` or
  - `session_id` change
  - which can delay extraction if callers omit explicit close signal.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/service_runtime.py`
  - added hard dedupe check:
    - `agent_end` session-close fallback now skips sessions that already have non-failed `openclaw_main_turn_proxy` extraction events.
  - added window-level dedupe registry for OpenClaw extraction scheduling:
    - builds/uses `dedupe_key` for `openclaw_main_turn_proxy` and `openclaw_agent_end_session_end`.
    - duplicate windows emit `status=skipped` extraction events instead of running duplicate jobs.
  - integrated archive idle sweep before `append_session_record`:
    - stale active sessions can be closed and extracted on next hook arrival.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_conversation_archive.py`
  - added config:
    - `session_idle_timeout_seconds` (default `0`, disabled)
  - tracks active-session touch timestamps.
  - added `sweep_inactive_sessions(user_id=...)` API.
  - keeps ended-session outputs deduplicated.
- config/install wiring:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/run_proxy.py`
    - new CLI/env:
      - `--openclaw-session-idle-timeout-s`
      - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/install.py`
    - writes `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S=0` into generated `.env`.
- verification scripts added:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/scripts/verify_sidecar.sh`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/scripts/verify_embedded.sh`
- docs updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`

### Tests Added/Updated
- added:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_conversation_archive.py`
    - idle-timeout disabled no-op
    - idle-timeout closes active session
- updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_service_runtime.py`
    - agent_end dedupe skip when main-turn extraction already exists
    - idle-timeout closure triggers session-end extraction scheduling
    - window-level dedupe skips duplicate scheduling
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_run_proxy_defaults.py`
    - default assertion for `openclaw_session_idle_timeout_s == 0`

### Validation
- Python tests:
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  - result: `40 passed, 0 failed`
- Adapter tests:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `35 passed, 0 failed`
- Embedded verification script:
  - `bash AutoSkill4OpenClaw/scripts/verify_embedded.sh`
  - result: pass (embedded + adapter test flows)

### Failed Attempts / Corrections
- Initial idle-timeout archive test used touch timestamp `0`, which is treated as invalid/no-touch by implementation.
- Corrected tests to use a minimal positive stale timestamp (`1`) and strengthened runtime timeout path assertion.

### Residual Risks / Next Candidates
- Sidecar verification script requires a running local sidecar service and real endpoint reachability; not executed in this round.
- If operators use very short idle-timeout values, sessions may be closed too aggressively in bursty workloads; recommended to keep timeout disabled (`0`) unless explicitly needed.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 10 (embedded invocation multi-fallback chain)

### Scope
- Target area: `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter` embedded extraction/maintenance model invocation.
- Objective: when runtime reflection cannot call model successfully, add full fallback chain:
  - `openclaw-runtime` (direct invoke + runtime target resolve)
  - `openclaw-runtime-subagent`
  - `openclaw-config-resolve`
  - `manual`

### Why this round
- User required a no-sidecar embedded path that does not depend on manual model config by default, but still has deterministic fallback behavior when runtime APIs are not available.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`
  - replaced single-path runtime invoke with multi-mode invocation chain.
  - added `openclaw-runtime` dual behavior:
    - try runtime direct model invoker functions first
    - if failed, resolve `base_url/api_key/model` from runtime object and call OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint.
  - added `openclaw-runtime-subagent` mode:
    - probes runtime subagent/internal reasoning methods (`runSubAgent` / `invokeSubAgent` / etc.).
  - added `openclaw-config-resolve` mode:
    - reads OpenClaw config candidates (`openclaw.json`, `models.json`, agent-level models) and resolves provider/model/base_url/api_key (including env references).
  - added `manual` mode:
    - explicit fallback for manual `base_url/api_key/model`.
  - HTTP-call path supports timeout/retry and remains fail-open (errors become extraction job failures, never block main conversation).
  - preserved recursion safety (`autoskill_internal` + internal depth guard) and session-close gating.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - added embedded invocation config normalization with env support:
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MODEL_MODES`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MODEL_RETRIES`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_OPENCLAW_HOME`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MANUAL_BASE_URL`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MANUAL_API_KEY`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_EMBEDDED_MANUAL_MODEL`
  - default invocation order set to:
    - `openclaw-runtime,openclaw-runtime-subagent,openclaw-config-resolve,manual`
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/openclaw.plugin.json`
  - added config schema for `embedded.modelInvocation`.
- docs updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`
  - embedded section now documents fallback order and new env knobs.

### Tests Added/Updated
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.test.mjs`
  - runtime direct failure -> runtime-target HTTP fallback.
  - runtime unavailable -> config-resolve fallback.
  - runtime+config unavailable -> manual fallback.
  - runtime subagent mode success path.
  - all modes fail -> fail-open result (`session_not_extractable` + per-session failed job).
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`
  - config normalization default mode order assertion.
  - env overrides for embedded invocation modes/timeouts/retries/openclawHome/manual params.

### Validation
- Adapter:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `41 passed, 0 failed`
- Plugin Python tests:
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  - result: `40 passed, 0 failed`
- Syntax:
  - `node --check AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - `node --check AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`
  - result: pass

### Failed Attempts / Corrections
- New embedded fallback tests initially failed due test helper shallow-merge behavior that dropped `embedded.sessionArchiveDir`.
- Corrected `makeConfig` in `embedded_runtime.test.mjs` to deep-merge embedded overrides.

### Residual Risks / Next Candidates
- `openclaw-config-resolve` is best-effort for heterogeneous OpenClaw configs; secret-ref/OAuth-only keys may remain unresolved and correctly fall through to next mode.
- Runtime object introspection is intentionally conservative to avoid hard-coupling to internal unstable APIs; if specific OpenClaw versions expose additional official runtime APIs, probe list can be extended with low risk.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 11 (subagent maintenance and merge hardening)

### Scope
- Target area: embedded `openclaw-runtime-subagent` path after candidate extraction.
- Objective: harden maintenance decision and merge behavior (not extraction-only), preventing unsafe merge and duplicate skill bloat.

### Issues Found
- Maintenance merge in embedded path could be overly permissive:
  - LLM `merge` decision with weak/invalid target could still drift toward wrong merge.
- Candidate parsing robustness gap:
  - subagent outputs may return `skill` object or direct object, not always `skills[]`.
- No deterministic duplicate guard before maintenance:
  - exact duplicate candidate could still enter decision pipeline and produce redundant skill files.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`
  - added skill payload normalization:
    - clamps (`name/description/prompt`) and dedupes triggers/tags.
    - extraction now accepts `skills[]`, `skill`, or direct object shape.
  - strengthened maintenance decision policy:
    - action normalization supports common synonyms.
    - merge requires valid explicit target id or high-confidence BM25 fallback (`score >= 0.72`).
    - unsafe merge now degrades to `add`.
  - removed blind `hits[0]` merge fallback in `maintainSkill`; merge now requires resolved valid target.
  - added deterministic duplicate guard before decision:
    - if candidate matches existing skill (prompt equality / strong normalized overlap), skip with `duplicate_existing_skill`.
  - retained fail-open behavior and recursion guard.
- docs updated (EN/ZH) to include embedded maintenance safety guards.

### Tests Added
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.test.mjs`
  - explicit merge target in subagent mode -> merged + version bump.
  - invalid/unsafe merge target -> fall back to add.
  - duplicate candidate -> skipped before maintenance call.

### Validation
- Adapter:
  - `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test`
  - result: `44 passed, 0 failed`
- Plugin Python tests:
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
  - result: `40 passed, 0 failed`

### Residual Risks / Next Candidates
- Current duplicate guard is conservative lexical matching; semantic near-duplicates still rely on BM25+LLM maintenance decision.
- If production data shows false merge/add boundaries, threshold (`0.72`) can be moved to config in a later low-risk round.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 12 (README mainline switch to no-sidecar embedded)

### Scope
- Target area: `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md` and `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`.
- Objective: make no-sidecar embedded runtime the primary user-facing mainline, with sidecar repositioned as optional.

### Changes
- Rewrote top-level positioning in EN/ZH docs:
  - mainline is now `runtimeMode=embedded` (no sidecar required).
  - sidecar moved to optional runtime/control-plane role.
- Reworked Quick Start in EN/ZH:
  - now starts from editing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` plugin config for embedded mode.
  - removed sidecar startup as mandatory step.
  - added local verification steps for SkillBank + OpenClaw mirrored skills.
- Reframed path sections:
  - default path diagrams/wording now describe embedded `agent_end` processing.
  - sidecar interaction moved under explicitly optional section.
- Updated env var grouping:
  - recommended path now lists embedded-oriented keys.
  - sidecar-only operations/endpoints are explicitly labeled.
- Clarified local storage paths for embedded vs sidecar archives.

### Validation
- Documentation consistency check by manual scan of EN/ZH files.
- No code-path changes in this round; runtime behavior unchanged.

### Residual Notes
- Runtime default in code remains backward-compatible (`sidecar`) unless explicitly configured to embedded; docs now instruct explicit embedded config for new deployments.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 13 (usage counting hybrid fallback: explicit + inferred)

### Scope
- Target area: OpenClaw plugin usage observability (`adapter -> service_runtime -> openclaw_usage_tracking`).
- Objective: improve count coverage in native OpenClaw skill flow while keeping prune safety unchanged.

### Issues Found
- Existing counting was explicit-signal heavy:
  - `used` could not be counted when runtime omitted `used_skill_ids`.
  - no retrieval snapshot + no explicit signal meant full skip (`no_retrieval_hits`).
- Prune safety requirement remained strict:
  - never let inferred signals drive auto-prune.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_usage_tracking.py`
  - added hybrid counting model:
    - `skills_explicit` (store-backed strict counters, prune source)
    - `skills_inferred` (plugin-local inferred counters, persisted JSON)
    - `skills_combined` (observability aggregate only)
  - added synthetic fallback snapshot path:
    - if retrieval hits are missing but explicit/inferred used ids exist, build synthetic hits and still count.
  - added inferred signal resolver:
    - payload inferred ids
    - selected-for-use/context ids
    - optional assistant/tool message mention matching
  - prune remains explicit-only and still guarded by `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_PRUNE_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_USED_SIGNAL=1`.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/service_runtime.py`
  - extracts and forwards `inferred_used_skill_ids`.
  - passes message window to usage tracker for mention-based inference.
  - logs inference status in usage tracking line.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - adds best-effort collection of `inferred_used_skill_ids` from event/ctx/retrieval.
  - forwards inferred ids on `agent_end` payload when explicit ids are absent.
- Config wiring:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/run_proxy.py`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_INFER_ENABLED`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_INFER_FROM_SELECTED_IDS`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_INFER_FROM_MESSAGE_MENTIONS`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_INFER_MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS`
    - `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_USAGE_INFER_MANIFEST_PATH`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/install.py` writes default env entries for the new knobs.

### Tests Added/Updated
- Python:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py`
    - explicit-used fallback without retrieval hits
    - inferred counting when explicit used is absent
    - inference skip when explicit used is present
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_service_runtime.py`
    - inferred fallback end-to-end through `agent_end` and stats endpoint
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_run_proxy_defaults.py`
    - default assertions for new usage inference flags
- JS:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`
    - verifies `agent_end` forwards `inferred_used_skill_ids` when explicit signal is absent

### Validation
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_usage_tracking.py` (pass)
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_service_runtime.py` (pass)
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_run_proxy_defaults.py` (pass)
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'` (pass, 44 tests)
- `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test` (pass, 45 tests)

### Risk / Safety Notes
- Inferred counters are additive observability only; pruning still reads strict explicit counters.
- Main dialog/extraction path remains fail-open:
  - usage tracking errors are swallowed and only logged.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 14 (shared prompt pack for sidecar + embedded)

### Scope
- Target area: prompt consistency between sidecar prompt profile and embedded runtime.
- Objective: eliminate prompt drift by introducing one shared prompt source used by both paths.

### Issues Found
- Prompt definitions were split across:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/agentic_prompt_profile.py` (sidecar)
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js` (embedded)
- This created high drift risk when updating extraction / maintenance / merge policies.

### Fixes Applied
- Added shared prompt pack:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/openclaw_prompt_pack.txt`
  - includes reusable shared blocks plus sidecar/embedded templates:
    - `sidecar.extract.system`
    - `sidecar.extract.repair.system`
    - `sidecar.maintain.decide.system`
    - `sidecar.maintain.merge.system`
    - `embedded.extract.system`
    - `embedded.maintain.decide.system`
    - `embedded.maintain.merge.system`
- Added Python loader/renderer:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/openclaw_prompt_pack.py`
  - supports `{{block.*}}` and `{{var.*}}` template rendering
  - supports override path via `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_PROMPT_PACK_PATH`
  - fail-open fallback to built-in prompts when file is missing/invalid
- Wired sidecar prompt profile to shared templates:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/agentic_prompt_profile.py`
  - extraction, repair, maintenance decision, and merge prompts now render from shared pack first, then fallback to legacy inline prompt text.
- Wired embedded runtime to shared templates:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.js`
  - extraction/maintenance/merge system prompts now render from shared pack first, then fallback to legacy inline prompt text.
  - added embedded runtime logs for prompt-pack loaded/fallback path.

### Tests Added/Updated
- New Python tests:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_openclaw_prompt_pack.py`
    - default pack loads with version
    - sidecar + embedded extract prompts both include shared block marker
    - template fallback behavior
    - custom pack block/var rendering
- Updated JS tests:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/embedded_runtime.test.mjs`
    - verifies embedded runtime reads custom prompt pack templates and renders block/variable substitutions.

### Validation
- `python3 -m unittest AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_openclaw_prompt_pack.py` (pass)
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_agentic_prompt_profile.py` (pass)
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'` (pass, 48 tests)
- `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test` (pass, 46 tests)

### Documentation
- Updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`
- Added section explaining shared prompt pack path, override env, and fail-open fallback.

### Risk / Safety Notes
- Runtime behavior remains fail-open:
  - if shared prompt pack is unavailable or malformed, both runtimes automatically fallback to built-in prompts.
- No changes to OpenClaw memory slots / contextEngine / compaction / tools / provider routing.

## 2026-03-13 - Round 15 (prompt-pack config ergonomics + integration coverage)

### Scope
- Target area: shared prompt-pack operability and regression coverage.
- Objective: ensure prompt-pack path override works from standard plugin config (not env-only), and verify sidecar prompt-profile actually consumes the shared pack.

### Issues Found
- Embedded prompt-pack override was effectively env-driven:
  - `embedded_runtime.js` accepted `cfg.embedded.promptPackPath`, but `normalizeConfig` did not preserve this field.
- Sidecar tests validated prompt text content but did not explicitly prove that `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_PROMPT_PACK_PATH` can override prompt source end-to-end in prompt-profile builders.

### Fixes Applied
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.js`
  - Added `embedded.promptPackPath` to normalized config output.
  - Added default field in `DEFAULTS.embedded`.
  - Supports both plugin config and env override:
    - config: `plugins.entries.autoskill-openclaw-adapter.config.embedded.promptPackPath`
    - env: `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_PROMPT_PACK_PATH`
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/install.py`
  - Added `AUTOSKILL_OPENCLAW_PROMPT_PACK_PATH=` to generated `.env` template.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_agentic_prompt_profile.py`
  - Added integration-style test proving sidecar extract prompt can be overridden via shared prompt pack env path.
- `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter/index.test.mjs`
  - Added config normalization tests for prompt-pack override via config/env.
- Docs updated:
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.md`
  - `AutoSkill4OpenClaw/README.zh-CN.md`
  - now include both env and plugin-config override examples.

### Validation
- `python3 AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests/test_agentic_prompt_profile.py` (pass, 5 tests)
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s AutoSkill4OpenClaw/tests -p 'test_*.py'` (pass, 49 tests)
- `cd AutoSkill4OpenClaw/adapter && npm test` (pass, 48 tests)

### Residual Suggestions
- Parser/runtime consistency still uses two lightweight implementations (Python + JS) over one shared pack format.
- Current risk is low and covered by tests, but future work can factor a tiny formal schema test corpus (golden render cases) consumed by both test suites to further reduce parser drift risk.
