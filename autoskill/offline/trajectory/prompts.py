        "1. Abstract the Strategy: Focus on the successful orchestration of tools, step-by-step logic, and problem-solving strategies. Do not just record a sequence of specific events.\n"
        "2. Capture Robustness (Crucial): Explicitly extract checkpoints, fallback mechanisms, and retry logic. How did the agent handle tool errors or missing information? This is the core of a trajectory skill.\n"
        "3. De-identify & Generalize: Strip out specific payloads, transient IDs, local file paths, timestamps, and one-run values. Retain the underlying variable structure and output contracts.\n"
        "4. Major-Event Prioritization: When a trajectory contains multiple event branches, focus on the principal success-driving chain (the branch that actually determines task completion).\n"
        "5. Strict Relevance Filter: Exclude branches/events that are incidental, noisy, or not required to reproduce the core success path; when uncertain, prefer excluding them.\n"
        "6. Strict Null Condition: If the trajectory represents a highly specific, non-reusable instance, or if the tool orchestration policy is unclear, output {\"skills\": []}.\n"
        "7. User-Reuse Filter: If the extracted workflow is unlikely to be reused by the same target user/team in future similar trajectories, output {\"skills\": []}.\n\n"

        "2. Semantic Union, Not Concatenation: Do not just append text. Rewrite the Markdown prompt to flow logically as a single, well-structured system instruction.\n"
