Skill extraction.

This layer converts raw inputs (messages/events) into SkillCandidate objects:
- `HeuristicSkillExtractor`: offline heuristic extraction (builds a generic SOP when no LLM is available)
- `LLMSkillExtractor`: calls an LLM to produce structured JSON, with parsing/repair

LLM extraction strategy (strong -> weak):
1) parse JSON directly
2) recover key fields from non-JSON semi-structured text (common in “reasoning” outputs)
3) ask the model to repair the draft into strict JSON
4) if still unavailable/unparseable, skip extraction (return empty list)
