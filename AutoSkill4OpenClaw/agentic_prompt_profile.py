        "- Progressive disclosure: keep metadata triggerable, prompt body executable, and reusable helper content in optional resource files; do not embed large reference payloads.\n"
        "- Degrees of freedom: keep strict rules where operations are fragile, and preserve flexibility where multiple approaches are valid.\n"
        "- Triggerability matters: name and description are the always-loaded metadata, so they must clearly state what the skill does and when it should be used.\n"
